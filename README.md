# Individual-Project-Plan
An outline of my individual project for this course.



For my individual project, I plan on making a small website that hosts a typing game. The way it will work is that it will have
some sort of key logger in it. The key logger itself will not record the person's keystrokes perfectly. Instead, the person's 
keystrokes will be broken down so that an allmost perfect representation can be built back up at a later time. The game itself 
will have two modes to choose from, individual and competitive. For both modes, a small bit of text will appear on the screen, 
and the user will type it out. The user will have their keystrokes logged while doing this. In the end, the player will see his 
statistics such as how many word/minute he typed and how many errors there were. His logged keystrokes and statistics will be 
saved to a database and retrieved randomly when in competition. In competition, a random log will be pulled from the database 
corresponding to each set of text. The log will be built up and displayed comparatively to the player.



Outline:
1.) Figure out how the site should look.
2.) Build the key logger library.
3.) Build the web site.

Unknown how long each step will take. After all, we will be covering something new every week.
